Abstract = {{We present a fast and simple method to compute bundled layouts of
   general graphs. For this, we first transform a given graph drawing into
   a density map using kernel density estimation. Next, we apply an image
   sharpening technique which progressively merges local height maxima by
   moving the convolved graph edges into the height gradient flow. Our
   technique can be easily and efficiently implemented using standard
   graphics acceleration techniques and produces graph bundlings of similar
   appearance and quality to state-of-the-art methods at a fraction of the
   cost. Additionally, we show how to create bundled layouts constrained by
   obstacles and use shading to convey information on the bundling quality.
   We demonstrate our method on several large graphs.}},
